# Players

BaseX project 
Where I create two xq files and an xml that deals that is about soccer players

Here you can add your favorite players, teams, and their numbers and do not worry if that player changes teams you can update it with the function it offers you, you can search by team, remove the player or modify his number, team or name if he you want
